    "- The Average Displacement Error (ADE) is calculated as the mean Euclidean distance between the predicted and actual positions across all predicted timesteps for each agent, averaged over all agents.\n",
    "- The Final Displacement Error (FDE) is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the predicted and actual positions at the final predicted timestep, again averaged over all agents.\n",

    "The outputs provided give insight into the performance of two trajectory prediction models - the Constant Velocity Model (Q1) and the Constant Acceleration Model (Q2) - based on Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) metrics across three prediction horizons (1s, 2s, 3s). Here's a comparison and discussion of the observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average Displacement Error (ADE)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constant Velocity Model** shows increasing ADE values with longer prediction horizons: 0.2508 (1s), 0.6409 (2s), 1.2878 (3s). This trend indicates that prediction accuracy decreases as the prediction horizon extends, which is expected due to accumulating uncertainties in motion over time.\n",
    "- **Constant Acceleration Model** also exhibits a similar trend with ADE values: 0.2335 (1s), 0.5806 (2s), 1.1694 (3s). The ADE values are consistently lower across all horizons compared to the Constant Velocity Model, suggesting improved prediction accuracy when accounting for acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Displacement Error (FDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constant Velocity Model** shows FDE values increasing with the prediction horizon: 0.5151 (1s), 1.5804 (2s), 3.5408 (3s). This aligns with the expectation that errors in position prediction accumulate over time.\n",
    "- **Constant Acceleration Model** reports slightly lower FDE values than the Constant Velocity Model at all horizons: 0.4740 (1s), 1.4155 (2s), 3.2543 (3s). This suggests that incorporating acceleration into the prediction model offers a more accurate estimation of the agent's final position, especially for longer prediction horizons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy with Acceleration**: The Constant Acceleration Model generally provides more accurate predictions (lower ADE and FDE) compared to the Constant Velocity Model. This improvement underscores the importance of accounting for changes in velocity when predicting future positions, particularly in scenarios where agents frequently adjust their speed.\n",
    "- **Increasing Errors Over Time**: Both models exhibit increasing errors with longer prediction horizons, which is expected in trajectory prediction tasks. The accumulation of errors over time highlights the challenge of predicting movements accurately in dynamic environments.\n",
    "- **Model Selection Based on Scenario**: While the Constant Acceleration Model shows better overall performance, the choice between these models should consider the specific requirements and constraints of the application scenario. For example, the Constant Velocity Model may suffice in scenarios with mostly uniform motion, offering simpler computations."
